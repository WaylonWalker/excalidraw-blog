What makes Excalidraw so great is the simplicity and of course we don't want to start adding more and more features, as this simplicity will be lost. What we can do though is to make use of one of our latest feature, which is the library.

<!-- end -->

The first implementation was made by [Pete Hunt](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/1787) a few months back. So by now you might already know how you can easily start adding shapes to the library that you use often for later use in different diagrams (press `9` or shoose it from the top menu). Afterwards you can export it and share with others or open an existing library that you found somewhere else.

Another way to import is to upload your library somewhere (like [gist](http://gist.github.com/)) and then getting the link to the raw file you can use the following URL to add the shapes directly into your library like this:

```
https://excalidraw.com/?addLibrary=<link-to-excalidrawlib>
```

### Polygons and Stars example

As an example you can add [polygons](https://excalidraw.com/?addLibrary=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lipis/c148134151ac57b7f5df62cba69a4ee4/raw/a52fa9df8fc892e0a63d48aa6f3645299922bcc2/polygons.excalidrawlib) or [stars](https://excalidraw.com/?addLibrary=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lipis/a0de24a467a2869ed45635fa976afdcf/raw/ace7e402f7b0e48dc6738ddac6b5e6608b2aa7d4/stars.excalidawlib) into your library and modify them as you need.

Here is how the look and what is going to be imported and as awlays you can click the images and open the scenes in Excalidraw.

If you are interested in how these shapes were done you can check the Python source: [`polygons.py`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw-playground/blob/master/py-excalidraw/polygons.py) ans [`stars.py`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw-playground/blob/master/py-excalidraw/stars.py). Feel free to modify them to fill your needs or create other shapes easily based on these examples.
